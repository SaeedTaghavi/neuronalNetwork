# Neuronal Network

The aim of this project is to build a network of biological neurons or [neural circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_circuit)
A neural circuit is a population of neurons interconnected by synapses to carry out a specific function when activated.

## Getting Started

```
git clone https://github.com/SaeedTaghavi/neuronalNetwork

```
